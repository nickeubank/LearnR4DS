    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset structure\n",
    "\n",
    "More important than learning the mechanics of creating a dataset in\n",
    "R is to understand their general structure: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each column should consist of a vector that gives some fact about\n",
    "the world (e.g., age in years). We usually refer to these columns\n",
    "as *variables*. \n",
    "2. At least one column should identify who or what the information in\n",
    "the data is about.  Such a variable is called an \"id\" variable or\n",
    "\"key\". In the `children` dataset above this variable is `name`. The\n",
    "remaining variables have the facts or measurements that we care\n",
    "about. For example, we gather from the dataset that Al is 6 years old\n",
    "(one fact) and that Al has brown hair (a second fact).\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the proper structure of datasets, let's create a\n",
    "second data frame. Suppose here that `gdp_pc` is a measure of a\n",
    "country's GDP per capita in a given year. (Use `?expand.grid` and\n",
    "`?runif` to learn more about these functions, though that is not a\n",
    "priority right now.)"

    "This time around our dataset has two id variables: `country` and\n",
    "`year`. Why two and not one? One way to think about it is that\n",
    "`country` by itself wouldn't be sufficient to uniquely identify a row,\n",
    "because there are three rows for each country (and likewise with\n",
    "`year`). Combined, however, `country` and `year` uniquely identify\n",
    "each row. In other words, GDP per capita (the only fact or measurement\n",
    "in this dataset) describes a given country in a given year.\n",
