RStudio is a little \"helper\" program that makes it a little easier to write code for R (it is what is referred to as an \"integrated development environment\" (IDE)). There are also a lot of other IDEs, but RStudio is the easiest and one of the most popular. "

In screenshot below, for example, I'm about to ask R to print the phrase \"Hello!\" (though I haven't hit return, so it hasn't done anything yet):\n",
